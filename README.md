# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository serves as a record of my journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from basic to advanced concepts. Throughout this learning process, I have performed various operations, implemented algorithms, and worked with different data structures to strengthen my understanding of DSA.

## Learning Path

My learning path in DSA has been structured as follows:

1. **Introduction to DSA**:
   - Studied the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms.
   - Gained a solid understanding of time and space complexity analysis.

2. **Arrays**:
   - Implemented basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   - Explored array manipulation techniques and algorithms.

3. **Linked Lists**:
   - Created singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
   - Implemented common operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.
   - Worked on advanced techniques, such as reversing linked lists.

4. **Stacks and Queues**:
   - Developed stack and queue data structures.
   - Applied these structures to solve problems involving parsing and scheduling.

5. **Trees**:
   - Studied binary trees and binary search trees (BST).
   - Implemented tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
   - Learned about self-balancing trees (e.g., AVL and Red-Black trees).

6. **Graphs**:
   - Explored different graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).
   - Implemented graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS).
   - Worked on graph problems like shortest path and cycle detection.

7. **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**:
   - Implemented classic sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
   - Explored searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search).
   - Analyzed their time and space complexities.

8. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Solved dynamic programming problems, focusing on optimization and memoization.
   - Worked on examples like the Fibonacci sequence and the knapsack problem.

9. **Advanced Topics**:
   - Delved into advanced topics such as hashing, tries, and advanced graph algorithms.
   - Studied algorithmic paradigms like Divide and Conquer, Greedy, and Backtracking.
